There will be a second column with a heading Saved Properties, along side the Resultscolumn. It will contain the initial property within the “saved" array
Hovering over a property card in the Results column will display an ’add’ button. Clicking the ‘add’ button will create the property in the Saved Properties column. Hovering over a property card in the Saved Properties column will display a 'remove’ button. Clicking the ‘remove' button will remove the property from the list of saved properties.

What we are looking for:
•	Code separated into Modules where appropriate. (AMD/Commonjs/ES6) etc
•	Logical sequence of commits so we can see how you came to the solution.
•	Testing, (Capturing the business logic of the above requirements) or at the very least around the adding and removing of data.
•	Instructions on building the project and some documentation.
